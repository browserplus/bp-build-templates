BrowserPlus Build Templates

This project provides a framework for easy authoring of BrowserPlus
services.

An example service based on this framework may be found at:
http://github.com/browserplus/bp-pubsub.


To use this framework:

1) Either download the files or setup bp-service-framework as a git
submodule of your project.  The projects listed above demonstrate the git
submodule approach.

2) If you use CMake to build your service, you may find it convenient for
your CMakeLists.txt to include cmake/BuildConfigs.cmake to setup
some default compiler/linker settings.

3) If you use Ant to automate building your service, you may find it convenient
for your build.xml files to include ant/build.xml to setup standard ways
of building, instrumenting, and/or testsing your service.
